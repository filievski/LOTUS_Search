# LOTUS: Linked Open Text Unleashed
API and web interface of LOTUS, award-winning full-text index to the LOD Laundromat, and the largest available LOD index today.

LOTUS was developed at VU University Amsterdam, as a collaboration between CLTL and the Knowledge Representation & Reasoning departments.

## Documentation

See http://lotus.lodlaundromat.org/docs for detailed description of the API parameters.

## Web interface

Also, try our web interface at http://lotus.lodlaundromat.org/ or http://lodsearch.org. 
Note: While the visual appearance of LOTUS has been changed since it has been presented at ESWC 2016, its functionality has been kept unchanged. The ESWC 2016 interface of LOTUS is still functional and can be accessed at http://lodsearch.org/eswc.
